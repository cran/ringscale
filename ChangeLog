* Released as ringscale_0.1.2 2009-10-21
	In misc.R
		function 'header.find' now always returns a character
		vector of length 1 ("" if key was not found in the header
		data) - this led to errors in the case of no given FITS headers
		
	In ringscale.R
		added declaration of 'hypotheses.combined' at the beginning of
		the function 'evaluate' to get rid of the CRAn check note:
			checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
			evaluate: no visible binding for global variable
			‘hypotheses.combined’
		
		added the option to skip reading out FITS header data
		for the funvtion 'analyze()' via the parameter 'header.skip'
		
		some minor bug fixes
